/**
 * Regression guard for #1767: gsd-workflow-guard.js must be registered in settings.json
 *
 * The hook file is built, copied, and installed — but was never registered as a
 * PreToolUse hook entry in install.js. This test ensures the registration block
 * exists with the correct structure.
 *
 * Also tests the broader anti-pattern: every hook in gsdHooks that is a JS
 * PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook should have a corresponding registration block.
